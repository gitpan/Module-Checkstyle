Revision history for Module-Checkstyle

0.03 Wed Nov 23 2005
  - Refactored make_problem into new_problem and added support for passing config + directive instead
    of just a severity. new_problem will discover the caller and get the severity from there
  - Added INFO and CRITICAL levels to possible severities
  - Added [Variable] checks with checks for matches-name, arrays-in-plural and hashes-in-singular
  - Improved processing of $line argument to make_problem function
  - Refactored some code to follow my own guidelines
  - Renamed 'disallow-fully-qualified-names' to 'no-fully-qualified-names' in [Subroutine] checks
  - Added 'no-calling-with-ampersand' check to [Subroutine] checks

  - Corrected t/00-base.t to handle ignore_common test correctly for non CVS checkouts of M::C
